#Programming the Game of War#  

We are going to combine these two versions of the card game WAR.

##War IRL##
This version of War has a poetic similarity to war in real life; no one wins in war. 
If both players play a card of the same value (ranging from low to high, 2-Ace), 
both players remove that card from play. Coincidentally, this is also an easy 
version of the game for programmers to practice on since more than two 
cards will never be used at once.  

##Instant War##
Any card that loses a battle is dead, or eliminated from the game. 
The card that wins returns to the original owner. When cards tie, only one card 
is played by each player in the war. A draw is possible, 
and game play is much quicker.
